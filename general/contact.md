# Contact

## Slack

Generally, the best place to find help about the project's modules and get in contact with team and users would be the [PSFramework Slack Community](https://psframework.slack.com).

It's free to use and [everybody is welcome to join](https://communityinviter.com/apps/psframework/psframework)

## Github

When something is broken about one of the project's modules, or you have a feature request, or you want to start a discussion that can be better tracked than is possible in Slack, it may be time to open an issue in the relevant module project.
