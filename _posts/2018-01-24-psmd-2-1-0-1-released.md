title: PSModuleDevelopment 2.1.0.1 released - Wrapping 'dotnet new'
---

Today we released version 2.1.0.1 of the PSModuleDevelopment module.

This latest release includes:

 - Tests. Lots of tests. This release marks the start of our new CI/CD channel, ensuring the quality of this and any future release(s).
 - New command: New-PSMDDotNetProject
   A wrapper around `dotnet.exe new`

# New-PSMDDotNetProject

This is a wrapper around the `dotnet.exe new` command, shipped as part of dotnet.exe when installing Visual Studio. This cli tool allows creating projects from templates, as well as managing the available templates.
The module's latest command addition ships with the alias `dotnetnew` and tries to emulate the functionality of the base command, but also includes tab completion for:

 - Available project types when creating a new project from template.
 - Available templates for installation from the online repository
 - Available templates for removal from the local template store
