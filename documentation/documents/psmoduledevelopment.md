# PSModuleDevelopment Documentation

The module `PSModuleDevelopment` is aimed at developers writing code, whether it is a full module, or individual scripts. It consists of several components - groups of commands and resources dealing with one issue or providing functionality of a given type.

## Templates
```powershell
Get-PSMDTemplate
Invoke-PSMDTemplate
New-PSMDTemplate
Remove-PSMDTemplate
```

The Templates component provides a simple and fast way to generate templates and create files & projects from templates.

It helps the developer set up shop faster and includes mechanics to share templates, allowing consistent templates across the project.

For more details on the templating system, see the [dedicated component page](documentation/documents/psmoduledevelopment/templates.html)
